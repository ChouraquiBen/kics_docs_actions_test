  "detailedDescriptionText": "VPC peering route tables should use restricted CIDR blocks to limit the network access between peered VPCs.\n\nConfiguring routes with overly permissive CIDR blocks (like 0.0.0.0/0) in VPC peering connections can expose your entire network to the peered VPC, significantly increasing your attack surface. This violates the principle of least privilege for network access.\n\nRestrict routes by using specific, narrow CIDR blocks that only allow necessary traffic between the peered VPCs. Define each route with the minimum required network range, limiting access to only the subnets and resources that need to communicate across the peering connection."
