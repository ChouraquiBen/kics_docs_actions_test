  "detailedDescriptionText": "Amazon MQ brokers should not be publicly accessible to minimize the risk of unauthorized access.\n\nPublicly accessible message brokers expose critical messaging infrastructure to the internet, creating potential entry points for attackers to intercept sensitive messages, inject malicious payloads, or perform denial of service attacks. Message brokers typically operate within internal network boundaries as part of application infrastructure.\n\nDisable public accessibility by setting 'publicly_accessible = false' in your aws_mq_broker resource. Deploy brokers in private subnets with appropriate security groups that restrict access to only authorized application components. Use VPC endpoints, peering connections, or VPN connections for clients located outside the broker's VPC."
