  "detailedDescriptionText": "AWS DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) clusters should always have server-side encryption at rest enabled to protect sensitive data. This vulnerability occurs when the 'server_side_encryption' block is missing, included but empty, or has the 'enabled' attribute set to false in the Terraform configuration.\n\nWhen DAX clusters lack encryption, all cached data is stored in plaintext, creating significant security and compliance risks. DAX is designed to improve DynamoDB performance by caching frequently accessed data, which means it often contains the most sensitive and valuable information from your database. Without encryption, this data is vulnerable to unauthorized access if the underlying storage is compromised.\n\nTo properly secure your DAX cluster, always include the 'server_side_encryption' block with the 'enabled' attribute set to true in your Terraform configuration. This ensures all data stored in the DAX cluster is encrypted at rest using AWS managed encryption keys, protecting your cached data from unauthorized access.\n\nImplementing encryption for DAX clusters is not only a security best practice but also essential for meeting compliance requirements such as GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS, and other regulatory standards that mandate the protection of sensitive data. Additionally, enabling encryption has minimal performance impact while providing significant security benefits."
