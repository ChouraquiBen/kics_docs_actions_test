  "severity": "HIGH",
  "category": "Access Control",
  "descriptionText": "S3 Buckets must not allow List Action From All Principals, as to prevent leaking private information to the entire internet or allow unauthorized data tampering / deletion. This means the 'Effect' must not be 'Allow' when the 'Action' is List, for all Principals.",

  "detailedDescriptionText": "Allowing List actions from all principals in an S3 bucket policy enables anyone to enumerate all objects in the bucket, revealing filenames and potentially exposing sensitive information through metadata or naming conventions. This configuration creates an information disclosure vulnerability that can aid attackers in identifying valuable targets for further exploitation. S3 bucket listing capabilities should be restricted to specific authorized principals following the principle of least privilege, particularly for buckets containing confidential or proprietary information."
