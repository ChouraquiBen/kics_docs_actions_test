  "detailedDescriptionText": "AWS EBS (Elastic Block Store) default encryption should always be enabled to ensure that all new EBS volumes are automatically encrypted without requiring explicit configuration for each volume. When default encryption is disabled by setting 'enabled' to false in the 'aws_ebs_encryption_by_default' resource, it creates a significant security risk as unencrypted volumes may be created.\n\nUnencrypted EBS volumes can expose sensitive data if the physical storage media is compromised, if snapshots are accessed inappropriately, or if the EC2 instance is terminated and the storage is reassigned. This vulnerability is particularly concerning for volumes that store sensitive information such as personal data, credentials, financial information, or proprietary business data.\n\nTo properly secure your AWS environment, set the 'enabled' attribute to true in your 'aws_ebs_encryption_by_default' resource, or omit the attribute entirely as it defaults to true. This ensures that all new EBS volumes created in your AWS account will be encrypted by default, regardless of whether encryption is specified during volume creation.\n\nImplementing default EBS encryption is a simple yet effective security measure that helps meet compliance requirements such as GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS, and other regulatory standards that mandate the protection of sensitive data. It provides an additional layer of defense with minimal performance impact and no additional cost, making it a best practice for securing your cloud infrastructure."
