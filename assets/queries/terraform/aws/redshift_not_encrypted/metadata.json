  "detailedDescriptionText": "Unencrypted Redshift clusters store data in plaintext, potentially exposing sensitive information to unauthorized users if storage media is compromised or improperly decommissioned. Redshift often contains large volumes of business-critical data and personally identifiable information, making it a high-value target for attackers. Enabling encryption using AWS KMS adds a critical layer of data protection with minimal performance impact and helps organizations meet regulatory compliance requirements for data privacy and security."
