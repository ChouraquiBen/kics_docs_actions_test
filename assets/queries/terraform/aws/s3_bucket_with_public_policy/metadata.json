  "detailedDescriptionText": "S3 buckets should be configured to prevent public policy attachments that could expose sensitive data.\n\nAllowing public policies on S3 buckets creates a significant risk of data exposure, as misconfigured bucket policies can inadvertently grant public access to bucket contents. This vulnerability could lead to data breaches and compliance violations.\n\nImplement public access controls by enabling the 'block_public_policy' setting in the aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block resource. Additionally, enable 'restrict_public_buckets' to prevent public access granted through bucket ACLs or policies, and consider applying these restrictions at both the bucket and account levels."
