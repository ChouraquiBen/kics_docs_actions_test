Proper DNS configuration is essential for both functionality and security.\n\nEnsure all Route53 record resources have properly defined required attributes including 'zone_id', 'name', 'type', and either 'records' or an appropriate alias configuration. Validate that record values point to legitimate resources and follow DNS best practices for your domain naming strategy."
