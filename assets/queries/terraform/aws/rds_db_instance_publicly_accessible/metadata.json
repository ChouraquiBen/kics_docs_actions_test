  "detailedDescriptionText": "RDS database instances should not be publicly accessible over the internet ('publicly_accessible = false').\n\nPublicly accessible databases present a critical security risk, exposing your data to potential brute force attacks, denial of service attempts, and exploitation of database software vulnerabilities.\n\nInstead, keep databases in private subnets and implement a secure access pattern. Application servers can be placed in separate subnets with specific security groups to access the database. For administrative access, use a bastion host, VPN connection, or AWS Systems Manager Session Manager.\n\nApply defense in depth by also implementing encryption, strong authentication, regular patching, and monitoring for suspicious access attempts."
