      "descriptionText": "AWS Lambda functions should have the TracingConfig property set with `mode = \"Active\"` to enable active tracing, which provides detailed request and performance monitoring through AWS X-Ray. When `tracing_config` is either omitted or configured as `mode = \"PassThrough\"`, as shown below, tracing data will not be automatically captured for Lambda invocations:\n\n```\ntracing_config {\n  mode = \"PassThrough\"\n}\n```\n\nWithout active tracing, teams lose critical visibility into Lambda execution, making it harder to detect and troubleshoot performance issues or security incidents in serverless environments."
