  "descriptionText": "Azure MySQL servers must enforce TLS encryption by setting ssl_minimal_tls_version_enforced to 'TLS1_2'. This ensures secure connections and protects data in transit.",

  "detailedDescriptionText": "Using outdated TLS versions (1.0 or 1.1) in Azure MySQL servers exposes database connections to known cryptographic vulnerabilities and attack techniques that have been addressed in TLS 1.2. Older TLS protocols have weaknesses in their cipher suites, protocol design, and implementation that could allow attackers to decrypt or manipulate encrypted database traffic. Organizations should enforce TLS 1.2 as the minimum version for all MySQL database connections to ensure strong encryption standards, mitigate known TLS vulnerabilities, and maintain compliance with industry security standards and regulations."
